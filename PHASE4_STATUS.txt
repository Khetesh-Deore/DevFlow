   - Test case validation and scoring
   - Contest participant score updates
   - Problem stats updates
   - User stats updates
   - Real-time Socket.io notifications
   - Error handling with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)

3. Sandbox Client Service (backend/services/sandboxClientService.js)
   - HTTP client for sandbox communication
   - Response normalization
   - Health check functionality
   - Supported languages retrieval
   - Error handling for connection issues

4. Submission Routes (backend/routes/submissionRoutes.js)
   - POST /api/contests/:contestId/problems/:problemId/submit
   - GET /api/submissions/:id
   - GET /api/submissions (user submissions with filters)
   - GET /api/contests/:contestId/submissions (admin only)

5. Server Integration (backend/server.js)

DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED:
- bull: ^4.11.5 (job queue)
- redis: ^4.6.10 (queue backend)
- socket.io: ^4.6.1 (real-time communication)

TESTING:
- Test file created: test-phase4.js
- Tests submission flow end-to-end
